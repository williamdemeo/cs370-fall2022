HOMEWORK SOLUTIONS POLICY.

You may not share homework solutions with anyone outside our class.  Doing so will be considered a violation of the Student Code of Conduct and will be reported to the Dean of Students and may be subject to severe punishment, ranging from a failing grade in this course to suspension or expulsion from the university.
